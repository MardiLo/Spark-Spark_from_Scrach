calls, air-breathing batteries"",""body"":""A sign stands outside the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg Buildings stand at the International Business Machines Corp IBM Almaden Research Center campus in the Santa Teresa Hills of San Jose California Photographer Tony Avelar Bloomberg By 2015 your mobile phone will project a 3 D image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy At least that s what International Business Machines Corp sees in its crystal ball The predictions are part of an annual tradition for the Armonk New York based company which surveys its 3 000 researchers to find five ideas expected to take root in the next five years IBM the world s largest provider of computer services looks to Silicon Valley for input gleaning many ideas from its Almaden research center in San Jose California Holographic conversations projected from mobile phones lead this year s list The predictions also include air breathing batteries computer programs that can tell when and where traffic jams will take place environmental information generated by sensors in cars and phones and cities powered by the heat thrown off by computer servers These are all stretch goals and that s good said Paul Saffo managing director of foresight at the investment advisory firm Discern in San Francisco In an era when pessimism is the new black a little dose of technological optimism is not a bad thing For IBM it s not just idle speculation The company is one of the few big corporations investing in long range research projects and it counts on innovation to fuel growth Saffo said Not all of its predictions pan out though IBM was overly optimistic about the spread of speech technology for instance When the ideas do lead to products they can have broad implications for society as well as IBM s bottom line he said Research Spending They have continued to do research when all the other grand research organizations are gone said Saffo who is also a consulting associate professor at Stanford University IBM invested 5 8 billion in research and development last year 6 1 percent of revenue While that s down from about 10 percent in the early 1990s the company spends a bigger share on research than its computing rivals Hewlett Packard Co the top maker of personal computers spent 2 4 percent last year At Almaden scientists work on projects that don t always fit in with IBM s computer business The lab s research includes efforts to develop an electric car battery that runs 500 miles on one charge a filtration system for desalination and a program that shows changes in geographic data IBM rose 9 cents to 146 04 at 11 02 a m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading The stock had gained 11 percent this year before today Citizen Science The list is meant to give a window into the company s innovation engine said Josephine Cheng a vice president at IBM s Almaden lab All this demonstrates a real culture of innovation at IBM and willingness to devote itself to solving some of the world s biggest problems she said Many of the predictions are based on projects that IBM has in the works One of this year s ideas that sensors in cars wallets and personal devices will give scientists better data about the environment is an expansion of the company s citizen science initiative Earlier this year IBM teamed up with the California State Water Resources Control Board and the City of San Jose Environmental Services to help gather information about waterways Researchers from Almaden created an application that lets smartphone users snap photos of streams and creeks and report back on conditions The hope is that these casual observations will help local and state officials who don t have the resources to do the work themselves Traffic Predictors IBM also sees data helping shorten commutes in the next five years Computer programs will use algorithms and real time traffic information to predict which roads will have backups and how to avoid getting stuck Batteries may last 10 times longer in 2015 than today IBM says Rather than using the current lithium ion technology new models could rely on energy dense metals that only need to interact with the air to recharge Some electronic devices might ditch batteries altogether and use something similar to kinetic wristwatches which only need to be shaken to generate a charge The final prediction involves recycling the heat generated by computers and data centers Almost half of the power used by data centers is currently spent keeping the computers cool IBM scientists say it would be better to harness that heat to warm houses and offices In IBM s first list of predictions compiled at the end of 2006 researchers said instantaneous speech translation would become the norm That hasn t happened yet While some programs can quickly translate electronic documents and instant messages and other apps can perform limited speech translation there s nothing widely available that acts like the universal translator in Star Trek Second Life The company also predicted that online immersive environments such as Second Life would become more widespread While immersive video games are as popular as ever Second Life s growth has slowed Internet users are flocking instead to the more 2 D environments of Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc Meanwhile a 2007 prediction that mobile phones will act as a wallet ticket broker concierge bank and shopping assistant is coming true thanks to the explosion of smartphone applications Consumers can pay bills through their banking apps buy movie tickets and get instant feedback on potential purchases all with a few taps on their phones The nice thing about the list is that it provokes thought Saffo said If everything came true they wouldn t be doing their job To contact the reporter on this story Ryan Flinn in San Francisco at rflinn bloomberg net To contact the editor responsible for this story Tom Giles at tgiles5 bloomberg net by 2015, your mobile phone will project a 3-d image of anyone who calls and your laptop will be powered by kinetic energy. at least that\u2019s what international business machines corp. sees in its crystal ball."",""url"":""bloomberg news 2010 12 23 ibm predicts holographic calls air breathing

to blow the mothballs off of this legendary masterpiece Solid hard nosed and pure Meet Pete Rose 49 Houston Aeros Away Jersey These designers have thrust their Aeros into the upper tier of the American Hockey League with this curious creation Aggressive yet elegant 48 Florida Panthers 3rd Jersey Blue and darker blue aren t exactly Panthers colors but this jersey as a whole reeks of solid domination On the other hand it also screams Pittsburgh Penguins 47 Pittsburgh Pirates Negro League Jersey There s nothing like Heritage Week to bring back the old days The Homestead Grays clearly believed in simplicity and class Less continues to be more 46 Edmonton Oil Kings Military Jersey This Western Hockey League club is prepared to do whatever it takes to cement its name in history forever And that includes fashioning a Jackson Pollack esque display of paint madness More simply referred to as the Military Appreciation Jerseys Abstract art at its finest 45 Cincinnati Stingers Away Jersey This 70s World Hockey Association masterpiece can t possibly be gulped all at once It s too powerful Here is the rest 44 Kingston Frontenacs Don Cherry Jersey The Kingston Frontenacs are still several suits away from reaching greatness but the Ontario Hockey League just got a lot cooler with this mockery of NHL analyst and nut Don Cherry Risky business though as this can often be misconstrued as brutal 43 Atlanta Braves Throwback Jersey Worn by Hank Aaron and his pack of Braves during the franchise s first two seasons in Atlanta 1966 67 this simple off white piece of cloth is

they beat the Chicago Blackhawks in 2009 for the Victoria Cup trophy 24 Boston Bruins 3rd Jersey With a bear hogging the center there s little about this jersey that doesn t scream amazing We may

Barrette on an Ottawa Senators message board 7 Chicago White Sox Throwback Jersey Dick Allen s hipster glasses and epic stare hog this intense moment but we re still intrigued by the powder blue button down The Ambrose Burnside sideburns complete this masterful shot 6 Los Angeles Lakers Throwback Jersey The Minneapolis Lakers would only last 13 years 1947 1960 but they certainly cemented

http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2008/07/05/the-alton-brown-flower-pot-smoker/	3294	"{""title"":""The Alton Brown Flower Pot Smoker "",""body"":""Friends built the Alton Brown flower pot smoker a few months back and then visited this weekend and convinced me to build one for the Fourth Getting the parts While the actual construction of the smoker is trivial I found that gathering all of the needed items was challenging Many of the items were hard to source If you live in Seattle the guide below should help tremendously Generally speaking I would recommend that you try ordering everything but the Pot Bowl and bricks online Pot size selection The two hardest to source parts drive pot size selection The terra cotta bowl is hard to find The 17 bowl is the largest I was able to find anywhere It is also really heavy so it is impractical to order online However if you can find an 18 bowl I would be pretty tempted to get an 18 pot You can definitely fit the Weber 22 5 replacement charcoal grate in the pot it is actually about 17 or possibly even the 18 5 grill grate it is slightly less than 18 in actual diameter Not only would you get more cooking surface but you d also have a much easier to source grate Parts List ItemPriceSourceComments17 Terra Cotta Pot 19Home DepotThey had these at City Peoples but I didn t stop there until later 17 Terra Cotta Bowl 22City Peoples Garden StoreHard to find Try garden nursery stores I think it is also called an azalea bowl Some people use saucers that they drill into Heat Element 10Walgreens AmazonThere are reports of insufficiently sized heat elements This is a 1000W element that others have had success with The Maxi Matic ESB 300X is nearly identical to the Walgreens element I originally used The interior wires are a little shorter and thinner but otherwise the construction is nearly identical 16 Grill grate 20Sutter Hearth Home in BallardThe standard Weber sizes 14 18 and 22 are available everywhere Unfortunately they don t fit Order a 16 grate online well in advance I ended up using a more expensive grill topper Grill Thermometer 14Sutter Home HearthShockingly hard to find Try ordering online Pan for wood chips unkour kitchenShould be easy to find Get as heavy a pan as possible Ceramic Pot feet 6Stoneway HardwareThese are pretty easy to find elsewhere 3 Bricks 1 50Home DepotCould be 2 4s or anything else to get the smoker above the base 5 lb Pecan Wood Chunks 15Sutter Hearth HomePlan ahead and consider ordering online I later found Apple and Cherry chunks at Stoneway hardware for much less We used about 2 3 of the wood Getting the Heat Element controls out of the smoker I wanted to get the controls for the heat element outside of the smoker so that I could adjust the heat without opening the smoker This approach had the added advantage of getting the plastic base and overheat sensor out of the hot pot This was shockingly easy to do These instructions are for the Walgreens hot plate which seems to be pretty commonly used I m assuming that you re smart enough not to plug in the hot plate Remove the screw that connects the burner to the plastic base There is just one screw and its in the middle of the burner at the top Disconnect the wires from the heat element They are meant to be easily disconnected and reconnected All you need to do is press the tab and pull the wire and connector off of the pin Place some foil or preferably a non conductor over the exposed base to catch any drippings that may fall out of the pot we had none escape Keep the foil clear of the control element Center the hot plate base amongst the bricks see photo and run the wires up the hole in the bottom Reconnect them to the heat element I don t think it matters but the fat wire was originally connected to the prong that runs to the center of the heat element I used both bricks and the pot holder feet so that I could raise the smoker up off the base plate and allow air to flow up through the hole in the pot I then placed a brick in bottom of the smoker to support the heat element and keep the electrical prongs off the base of the pot I had to chip the corners of the brick so that it could sit to the side of the hole for air flow Obviously the wiring is much more exposed than it was in the sealed hot plate It is actually very hard to touch the wires during operation but be careful Also I d highly recommend you ensure that you re plugged into a GFCI protected outlet all outdoor outlets in buildings built after the mid eighties are required to be GFCI protected Temperature management and monitoring The temp at the top of the grill does a good job telling the temp inside the smoker We kept wireless temp probes in the meat throughout the process Metal smokers vs the Flower Pot vs the Big Green Egg You can buy a metal smoker from Wal mart or other sources for less than you ll spend assembling the flower pot smoker I ve never cooked with a metallic smoker but based on other comments I ve read the inexpensive ones are thin and shed heat tremendously quickly When we were finished smoking the internal temp was about 210 Two hours later it was 140 Four hours later it was still warm to the touch The Terra Cotta simply holds the heat really well The ambient air was in the sixties with a strong wind on our roof deck However the flower pot is no match for the Big Green Eggs These ceramic smokers are massive The equivalent size to the flower pot is probably the Large Egg which has an 18 diameter cooking area weighs 140 lbs and retails for 700 Plus I can t imagine I d have had as much fun as I did figuring the flower pot smoker out Recipe We cooked two 4 5lb Boston Butts on the 4th using Alton Brown s recipe for the brine and rub It turned out fantastically well Enjoy UpdateHamilton posted a series of really good questions alongside one of the photos and I wanted to include the questions and my responses here as I think they ll help other people I was wondering if you think it would be feasible to run a second Walgreen s burner through that bottom hole and into the pot This may give me the potential for more heat and heat control in the winter months when the weather is a little cooler here in South Carolina Maybe stagger them in the pot one above the other Or even side by side standing up I don t think you ll need to do this We had trouble keeping the heat down in the target 220 range and never had the dial anywhere near the halfway point By the end of the session I don t think the dial would go any lower Also these are 1000W burners 9 Amps Many household circuits are 15 Amps some are 20 so you d run the risk of blowing a fuse if you plugged them into the same circuit However if you did do it I don t think you d want to stagger them as the heat from the lower one may melt the solder on the higher one Side by side would work but you d need something else to set the grate on Also when you disconnect the burner from the base do you have enough length in the wire to connect the burner back to the burner once you ve run it through the hole with the original connections or do I need to buy some extension wires It is tight but there is enough wire If you do need to get wire make sure it is thermally insulated What was the highest temp you were able to see in your cooker We accidentally let it rise to around 240 220 is the target At some point I ll do a controlled test but it could definitely go much higher Do you soak your wood chips as well as leave water in the bottom of the pan When do you like to put the chips in the cooker When the cooker comes up to temp We used chunks instead of chips as they are less likely to actually catch fire I ve read that you don t need to soak them but a friend advised to soak half This way the dry ones start smoking early and the wet ones start smoking later So you don t need to lift the top until later in the cooking process lifting the top lets out the smoke and cools everything slightly Do you end up adding more chips to the pan throughout the cooking process If so what is your advice for removing the grill surface and the meat We added wood once and only opened the top twice The second time we lifted the top was to rotate the butts The meat can be easily removed using foil and oven mitts We had a plate with foil on the side to set them on If you look carefully at the picture of the butts you ll see two screws sticking up through the cooking surface We gripped the screws with oven mitts and lifted it directly out it did take a bit of effort as it was kind of jammed down there To remove the upper pot lid have you come up with a good handle or do you have an alternative method As your graph shows I guess it s a little hot and awkward to fooling around with when it s that hot It shockingly isn t too hot to touch The lid measurements are from the interior The exterior of the terra cotta is definitely cooler Some people claim that they can use their bare hands I just used oven mitts but used my hands to make minor adjustments Would it be beneficial to drill more holes in the bottom of the pot to let in more fresh air or do you think that would let too much heat out I don t think you want to do this You don t want the wood to burn heavy air flow you want it to combust enough to smoke We had absolutely no problems with air flow "",""url"":""naffziger

in teen acne battle"",""title"":""Doctors Strike Mutating Bacteria In Teen Acne Battle Shots doctors strike mutating bacteria in teen acne battle : npr"",""body"":""Charles Bowman University of Pittsburgh A tiny bacteriophage virus can cripple the bacteria that cause troublesome acne on teens skin Acne the scourge of many an adolescent life is getting harder to treat but 80 percent of teenagers have some form of it Conventional treatment includes topical and oral antibiotics Studies are now finding the bacteria that cause acne are increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment Alternatively there are effective laser treatments But these are costly and typically not covered by insurance Now researchers are scrambling to come up with new treatments for acne One promising possibility involves harnessing a harmless virus living on skin that naturally seeks out and kills the bacteria that cause pimples People Always Notice It s every teenager s nightmare big blistery red bumps on their faces That s what people notice first about you so no matter how great of a person you are no matter how pretty your eyes are how nice your smile is people always notice the blemishes on your face says Rohini Bagrodia a really pretty 22 year old with beautiful eyes a great smile and a history of battling acne In school it meant avoiding the spotlight I would always shy away from those opportunities that would bring all the focus on me Bagrodia says She wouldn t take part in class discussions She wouldn t raise her hand And it s all because of a tiny bacteria that lives on the skin UCLA dermatologist Dr Jenny Kim says many people don t realize it s bacteria that cause acne Some people say your face is dirty you need to clean it more scrub more don t eat chocolate things like that But really it s caused by bacteria and the oil inside the pore allows the bacteria to overpopulate Kim says For most teenagers with mild acne over the counter products containing peroxide or salicylic acid are enough to clear up the acne But lots of teenagers end up in the doctor s office and getting antibiotics This was the hardest thing for Bagrodia No matter how much she followed doctors orders diligently cleaning her face and using antibiotic cream nothing worked Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria Dermatologist Elizabeth Martin is in private practice in Birmingham Ala and is a fellow with the American Academy of Dermatology She says these bacteria like many others are mutating quickly and becoming resistant to antibiotics Over the years we have seen an increase in this antibiotic resistant bacterium both in the U S and also worldwide Martin says She points to studies that show a tripling of drug resistant acne bacteria over the past few decades This means doctors can no longer rely on antibiotics alone Most doctors now use a combination of low dose antibiotics along with benzoyl peroxide which also kills acne causing bacteria As Martin says benzoyl peroxide works to decrease bacteria through a different mechanism than antibiotics and it helps to prevent development of resistant bacteria When we combine benzoyl peroxide along with an antibiotic patients tend to have better clearance of their acne than when we use antibiotics alone Other Treatment Options Retinoids vitamin A derivatives can also be used early on to treat acne Typically creams they work by unclogging pores before they become large inflamed bumps A stronger form called Accutane is used for severe acne It s a highly effective pill but it can cause serious side effects including depression and birth defects So the government regulates its use Intensely focused light and lasers can also help fight acne when other treatments fail Kim is also a researcher at UCLA In the room dedicated to light and laser therapy Kim points out what appears to be a half cylinder with stacks of oblong light bulbs Patients with acne can go right under blue light and they sit there for about 15 20 minutes and acne often improves after several treatments Kim says It s not known exactly how light therapy works to fight acne but Kim says studies indicate it destroys the bacteria Probably physically without giving it time to mutate and the other thing the light treatment can improve the inflammation that the bacteria causes in acne she says But laser and light therapy doesn t work for everyone It s expensive and typically not covered by insurance So Kim and colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh are also looking into an entirely new way to fight acne taking a harmless virus that lives on the skin and programming it to become a bacteria killer The virus is going to go and kill the bacteria that causes acne It s just going to break it apart and burst its membrane so there s no time for the bacteria to mutate she says It s sort of a surprise attack The approach is a promising way to get rid of acne without using antibiotics If further lab studies prove successful researchers will begin testing on people to see if viral therapy is both safe and effective in fighting acne as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting viruses. as acne bacteria develop resistance to antibiotic treatments, doctors turn to zit-fighting

http://www.second-opinions.co.uk/bottle.html	7461	"{""title"":""The bottled water fad UK "",""body"":""Part 1 Introduction One of the most profitable schemes ever devised to deprive the gullible of their money must be the sale of bottled water In the western world tap water is about as safe as it can be and it is relatively cheap Yet many people are prepared to pay up to 1 500 times as much when the same stuff comes in a bottle In this paper we will consider this phenomenon The bottled water boom was indeed an unlikely phenomenon Perhaps the strangest thing about it was that this bland commodity made its impact in Britain at the height of a recession and with raging inflation There was a general lack of money in people s pockets yet bottled water became an overnight success Strange too is the fact that present water companies boast of the purity of their product when the various impurities that mineral waters contain used to be the whole point of buying the stuff anyway Natural water is never purer than when it falls on the hills as rain Once it hits the ground however all that changes Seeping into the soil it moves underground through passages and caverns carved over the millennia eating away at the rock and dissolving metals salts and minerals along the way As it goes its character changes depending on the type of rock through which it passes Eventually it arrives in underground lakes or aquifers the sources of most bottled mineral waters Throw out the Bath water Since Roman times Bath Spa in Britain has been a centre renowned for its mineral springs and baths Little has changed since Roman times Bath spring waters have always had a reputation for health giving properties because of their natural origins But merely because they are natural and come from underground does not mean that they are safe to drink A study carried out by the University of Wales found elevated amounts of several elements regarded as poisonous in the water Bath s waters come up from some 22 miles below the surface On their way they absorb quantities of fluoride and sulphates well beyond the safety limits set for tap water It s the water which is good for you it is usually better to keep the minerals out The minerals can often do harm Over the past half century there has been a distinct shift of opinion Until the Second World War the waters of Bath were advertised and promoted on the amount of radioactivity they contained People believed that radioactivity was health promoting They don t believe that now and the radioactivity of Bath s spring water isn t mentioned today Travelling through the ground as it does Bath s water picks up more than minerals In 1979 a girl swimming in a pool dived down to where the source water was coming in and swallowed some of it Five days later she died of amoebic meningitis Tests showed that the amoeba was in the water and the pool was closed The fad in the bottle By the 1970s people had stopped taking the waters the fashion had faded and the days of health giving spring waters appeared to be over But an advertising campaign by the French company Perrier in 1974 was to bring about a dramatic change The Financial Times in an article on the Mineral and Spring waters market called the campaign a waste of time because bottled waters it said would be drunk only by cranks and foreigners How wrong they were Bottled water has become an extraordinary success story Sales of bottled water totalled 3 million litres in 1976 In just one decade that figure rose to 128 million litres and by 1991 some 300 million bottles of mineral water were drunk in Britain alone Wenche Marshall Foster Chairman and Chief Executive of Perrier UK predicts that the market will rise to one billion litres a year by the turn of the century A survey of 250 people from London and the Midlands published in 1992 found that a quarter of them never drank water directly from the tap Perrier has been joined by many other companies eager to cash in on the trend There are now 113 producers of bottled water in Britain from large hi tech bottling factories to small unsophisticated ones in garden sheds All are attempting to cash in on the 1 million a day UK market But the market is still dominated by the big names and supermarkets own brands Perrier owns Buxton Water Contrex Volvic Vichy Saint Yorre and others Scotland s Highland Spring which is owned by a consortium registered in Liechtenstein bottles for Tesco Sainsbury s and the Co op The image Whatever the brand name the image they project is the same cleanliness purity and health To sell a commodity at a high price to people who can get it for next to nothing out of the tap the image is all important and not always realistic Buxton Water is advertised on television and the bottle with pictures of the beautiful Derbyshire landscape The water is bottled in an industrial estate next to a busy railway yard Glyndwr Spring Water on the other hand is bottled by hand in a portacabin in a field Where they are bottled does not mean that they are necessarily contaminated but neither does it mean that they are necessarily safe to drink What is important is what is happening on the catchment area from which the water is taken Water is water What gives the different bottled waters their particular characteristics is the minerals and chemicals that they pick up in their passage through the ground and they will pick up any and all Most of the water is taken from a rural environment This means that to be safe to drink what happens on the earth through which they flow must be strictly controlled For example cattle and other animals excrete waste material Ground around springs should not be used for grazing Over large areas there should be no pesticides or herbicides used Do these areas get the degree of control they need Nobody knows there is no information Although all bottled waters are believed to be from natural springs some are not Some are from the same surface water sources as the local tap water and some are tap water Marwin UK Ltd based in a Manchester industrial estate markets a bottled water called Purefect 95 This comes straight out of a tap from the Manchester main water supply and is then purified further by the company Purefect 95 is not spring water but it is probably one of the cleanest and purest bottled waters on the market because the company s purification is in addition to all the checks cleaning and treating that the regulations demand of its public supply source Purefect 95 s label proclaims Purefect 95 is produced here in Manchester from upland water sources utilising the latest treatment techniques It is purified by a series of specialised processes which remove unwanted or potentially harmful chemicals giving you a wholesome water for all your drinking and culinary requirements With no minerals no organic or inorganic chemicals and no bacteria in it Marwin can claim with justification that it is the best bottled water you can buy Purefect 95 is not the only bottled tap water In the South Crystal Spring is bottled from London s tap water and the soft drinks giant Schweppes is planning to bottle tap water in Britain just as Coca Cola and Pepsi Cola already do in the USA The BBC1 consumer programme Watchdog looked at Designer Waters on 27 September 1996 The programme concentrated on Crystal Spring which is

Woman in the World by Richard Rhodes Hardcover 261 pages purchase close Purchase Featured Books Hedy s Folly The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr the Most Beautiful Woman in the World Richard Rhodes At the height of her Hollywood career actress Hedy Lamarr was known as the most beautiful woman in the world For most of her life her legacy was her looks But in the 1940s in an attempt to help the war effort she quietly invented what would become the precursor to many wireless technologies we use today including Bluetooth GPS cellphone networks and more An Unlikely Beginning A new book by Pulitzer Prize winning author Richard Rhodes sets out to rewrite America s memory of Lamarr Hedy s Folly The Life and Breakthrough Inventions of Hedy Lamarr The Most Beautiful Woman in the World chronicles her life and the inventive side that is not often mentioned Rhodes tells Rachel Martin guest host of weekends on All Things Considered that Lamarr had been fascinated with science as a child growing up in Austria but pursued acting instead Her first break into Hollywood came when she heard Louis Mayer of Metro Goldwyn Mayer studios was scouting for actors She went to see him in London He wasn t willing to offer her a very good deal so she said no and walked out having great confidence in herself Rhodes says When Lamarr found out Mayer was headed back to the United States she bought a ticket for the same boat Once she was aboard she found a way to make him long for her after all she was an actress And before the ship landed in New York she had a much much better contract the equivalent of about 3 000 a week for seven years he says Within a year with the appearance of her in the film Algiers opposite Charles Boyer she was a superstar Un Hollywood Rhodes says Lamarr was most often cast based on her looks and had few lines She quickly grew bored in Hollywood Hedy didn t drink She didn t like to party he says Her idea of a good evening was a quiet dinner party with some intelligent friends where they could discuss ideas which sounds so un Hollywood but Hedy had to find something else to do to occupy her time Rhodes says she had a drafting table installed in her house and started inventing Among her projects was an improved stoplight and a tablet that when dissolved in water created a soda similar to Coca Cola She laughed later and said Well it never really worked It probably tasted like an Alka Seltzer tablet which is basically what it was he laughs But she was constantly looking at the world and thinking Well how could that be fixed How could that be improved Enlarge Random House Richard Rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than 20 fiction and nonfiction books Random House Richard Rhodes is a journalist a historian and the author of more than 20 fiction and nonfiction books Inspired By War As she was inventing Rhodes says Lamarr was simultaneously glued to the events of World War II When German submarines began targeting passenger cruise liners he says she felt compelled to invent something to help the Allied cause She zeroed in on torpedoes which were powerful weapons but hard to control Rhodes says she thought that if they could be radio guided there was a better chance they would hit their target She understood that the problem with radio signals was that they could be jammed But if you could make the signal hop around more or less randomly from radio frequency to radio frequency then the person at the other end trying to jam the signal won t know where it is he says If they try to jam one particular frequency it might hit that frequency on one of its hops but it would only be there for a fraction of a second Thus her take on spread spectrum radio was born Lamarr and her co inventor composer George Antheil submitted their idea to the National Inventor s Council and received a patent for their Secret Communication System in 1942 They were anxious to share their invention with the Navy but got a lackluster response The Navy being the Navy if it hadn t been able to make a torpedo that worked obviously it wasn t going to be receptive to ideas coming in from outside Rhodes says The Navy basically threw it into the file Untouched For Years The Navy classified the patent as top secret and it remained untouched for years But after World War II the Navy was interested in developing a so called sonobuoy that would use sonar to detect submarines in the water and transmit the information to an airplane above However it needed a way to jam proof the signal between the buoy and the plane They resuscitated the idea of frequency hopping and built it into the sonobuoy And after that the whole system just spread like wildfire Rhodes says The military and private companies all started developing their own technologies around Lamarr s invention Today vestiges of her frequency hopping technique are found in most digital devices that communicate wirelessly But Rhodes says Lamarr s contribution was lost in the noise for decades In the 1990s when she was in her early 80s one of the pioneers of wireless communications for computers came across Lamarr s patent and realized she d never been honored He started the ball rolling so that one of the major communications organizations would give her one of its awards She by then had had so much bad plastic surgery that she didn t like to go out in public so she received the award by telephone he says When they called her up to tell her she would get the award her first words were Hedy Lamarr being Hedy Lamarr Well it s about time one of the biggest actresses of mgm's golden age, also lived a quiet life as an inventor. during world war ii, hedy lamarr invented a form of wireless communication that led to

sues Belleville officer "",""body"":""The city Belleville and a Belleville police officer are being sued by a man who claims he was wrongfully arrested and charged with falsely impersonating a police officer after wearing a T shirt with the word POLICE written across the front and back Adam C Weinstein of Missouri claims he was attending a pre Christmas party on Dec 23 2006 at about 11 34 p m at Crehan s Bar in Belleville according to the complaint filed Dec 22 in St Clair County Circuit Court When Weinstein initially arrived at the party he was wearing a green sweater with the black shirt bearing the word POLICE underneath the sweater After getting hot at the bar Weinstein removed his sweater to reveal the POLICE shirt the suit states Shortly afterwards Weinstein claims he was told that some police officers wanted to talk to him outside Once he arrived outside Weinstein was told to show officers his police identification the suit states But Weinstein was a licensed Emergency Medical Technician and a licensed security officer not a police officer so he had no credentials he claims Belleville police officer Jeff Vernatti placed Weinstein under arrest and placed handcuffs around his wrists but tightened them too tightly on Plaintiff according to the complaint After Weinstein asked if it was illegal to wear a T shirt with the word POLICE on it Vernatti told him to shut the f up you re real f ing stupid you are a dumb a with no common sense do you know how f ing stupid you are the suit states Vernatti then twisted Weinstein s wrists and quickly walked him across the parking lot Weinstein claims Vernatti shoved Weinstein against the police cruiser with such force that his belt buckle left an impression on his abdomen then pushed Weinstein into the back seat of the car according to the complaint When Weinstein asked Vernatti to loosen his handcuffs Vernatti instead tightened them and added a second pair onto his wrists the suit states After writing a non traffic complaint Vernatti let Weinstein go first telling him how lucky he was not to be charged with a felony and to be placed in jail Weinstein claims But before letting Weinstein leave Vernatti ordered him to take off his shirt in the cold weather according to the complaint All the while other Belleville officers stood by and did nothing the suit states Eventually Belleville s prosecuting attorney dropped the case the suit states Because of Vernatti s actions Weinstein suffered extreme emotional distress fright nervousness indignity humiliation insult loss of relationship and comfort and was forced to incur medical costs he claims Vernatti falsely arrested falsely detained illegally violently and improperly handcuffed and wrongly charged Weinstein with impersonating officers Weinstein claims He also used excessive force publicly embarrassed harassed verbally abused physically abused cause grievous and severe injuries to Weinstein violated Weinstein s protected civil rights and abused or misused their powers according to the complaint Vernatti s actions toward Weinstein were extreme and outrageous the suit states The city of Belleville failed to train its police officers in matters that do not constitute an offense failed to train its officers in matters that do not require individuals to be detained failed to implement policies and procedures to prevent against untrained officers from detaining and charging innocent individuals and failed to train and supervise competent police officers the suit states Weinstein claims his injuries were caused by someone who had final policymaking authority and that the city had a widespread practice of deliberate indifference to the prior improper conduct of Vernatti that the city s indifference is exemplified by its knowledge of previous allegations made by citizens of Vernatti s behavior that the city failed to investigate allegations and that the city failed to discipline Vernatti Belleville also failed to train other officers to stop Vernatti when he violated rights should have known that Vernatti had been accused of excessive force on at least one prior occasion and failed to prevent Vernatti s conduct on Dec 23 2006 according to the complaint In the five count suit Weinstein is seeking actual damages in excess of 250 000 punitive damages in excess of 200 000 plus attorney s fees costs and

Investigations is a recent read a tough one Yoder admits Yoder signed with the Army as a plumber and pipe fitter after high school When the Army saw his intelligence test scores it trained him to be an air traffic controller He served in Panama and Germany where his 21 year old son lives with an ex wife During Desert Storm he spent three months in Iraq driving across the sands to deploy radio beacons for aircraft While doing demolition training in Germany a premature explosion tore loose his left ear drum He now has 90 percent hearing loss in that ear his right ear is better but also damaged Yoder can hold one on one conversations but any background noise creates for him an incoherent jumble of sound When he left the military in 1992 Yoder focused on the skilled trades Outside of an office setting his hearing wasn t as much of a problem Plus he could work independently which fit his sense of being a loner He built boats did plumbing and spent several years installing telecommunications equipment until the dot com bust He then turned to home building and remodeling When Arkansas housing boom collapsed he hopped a bus to Florida Friends had said there was work He arrived in November and got a 750 a month apartment on Madeira Beach Yoder did three condo remodeling jobs in Dunedin before work dried up Not wanting to go into debt he left his apartment and rented a room at the Flamingo Hotel in Clearwater for a week while frantically searching for a job None materialized nor he said did the payment from his last remodeling gig It was mid February and cold when Yoder found himself without a roof I felt ashamed he said It makes you feel shameful that you weren t able to keep your s together Yoder s original thoughts about homeless people have an element of truth Some are mentally ill and substance abusers But an economy that has people talking about the Great Depression has produced more and more Todd Yoders people on the margin who find themselves out on the streets when work gets difficult to find It s just a very sad time in our country said Cliff Smith assistant director of Pinellas County s health and human services department Until this winter Yoder knew nothing about homeless shelters or soup kitchens which he associated with black and white photos from the 1930s He sought out a secluded bank on Stevenson Creek behind the Clearwater Shuffleboard Club where he used the remains of an old tree house to build a shelter The first night he slept on a bed of palm fronds He d come to use their thick bases as a primary fuel source for cooking Knowing that vagrants and strangers are seen as threats he avoided houses while going to and from his camp skirting along the creek bank to get to Edgewater Drive It was the first time in my life that I didn t have any options he said So I started operating in survival mode Under the palm trees mangroves and oaks he worked the creek bank digging in the muck at low tide for oysters and clams I guess I wasn t your normal homeless guy because I was eating oysters on the half shell and steamed clams From a screen door he fashioned a net he used to trap fish that he d lure into the shallows with oysters One afternoon seagulls visited the bank A hot meal Yoder thought The birds appeared to sense the hunter in him and flew off The minute it crossed my mind Hey roasted bird It was like they were psychic He now viewed homelessness from a different perspective which he put into a poem The man who was kingHuddled in the coldWatching the cars go byNot bothering a glance his wayA funny fateFor the man who would be kingHunger gnawsAt his bellyAt his mindHis soul Though prone to dark spells Yoder said he s never been treated for depression By the creek he became consumed by thoughts of suicide The choice was between hanging himself from a tree or jumping from the Sunshine Skyway I was just very despondent he said I felt utterly defeated He battled on going on foot from business to business looking for work To keep presentable and fight the growing stench of his body Yoder took sink baths at nearby Edgewater Park s public restroom The Clearwater Public Library saved him There he found a clean bathroom shelter and Internet service that allowed him to communicate with potential employers his son and his parents He told his family he was doing fine That s just basic pride and shame he said You don t want to admit to the people you care about the most that you ve completely screwed the pooch From the Clearwater library and the one in Dunedin he would get books to distract him and give him an edge Today he almost chuckles as he describes reading a book on how to interview for a job while picking leaves and twigs from his beard He also found other homeless people who told him about programs that could help Yoder discovered Clearwater s Homeless Emergency Project on the library s Internet On March 14 after a month on the creek bank the project s shelter took him in The Department of Veterans Affairs is paying for Yoder s bed at the Homeless Emergency Project through June 16 then he ll need to find other housing Social workers at the project are helping him develop an immediate survival plan Yoder himself is setting longer term goals He hopes to become eligible for VA disability compensation due to his hearing which worsens with time Yoder can t use his back to make a living forever Compensation from the VA could allow him to enroll at St Petersburg College to study sign language interpretation He sees it as a job he can do as he gets older and as a way to help himself as his hearing goes In his journey through the world of the homeless Yoder has been amazed by how many people he s met who are just like him skilled blue collar and suddenly destitute Not mentally unhinged Not addicts They are people he said who have run out of resources Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report Will Van Sant can be reached at

http://onlinebsn.org/2009/10-most-famous-medical-miracles-of-all-time/	6210	"{""title"":""10 Most Famous Medical Miracles of All Time "",""body"":""by Linda on December 17 2009 Medicine has come a long way within the past two centuries but sometimes accidents illnesses and deformities can confound even the most educated and experienced doctor The following list contains ten of the most famous medical miracles performed by doctors and perhaps by the patient s own will to survive These miracles consisted of a willingness on the part of doctors patients and parents to consent to medical treatment in an otherwise unbearable or fatal situation In most cases the miracles seem most obvious on the front end when patients survive or have overcome odds against living a normal life In all cases however the patients plights and the medical remedies have altered those patients lives forever Only time will tell if these patients continue to live a healthy if not totally normal life Survives Orthopedic Decapitation Doctors gave nine year old Jordan Taylor a one percent chance of survival after his skull was lifted from his vertebrae in an automobile accident Dr Richard Roberts connected Jordan s head with metal plates screws and rods and three months later Jordan returned to school He can walk and talk This is a medical miracle considering the extent of his injuries Survived Without Heart for 118 Days Fourteen year old D Zhana Simmons needed a new heart but the wait was longer than her current heart could bear Doctors including Dr Si Pham removed her heart and kept her alive for four months with two heart transplants that involved heart pumps During that time D Zhana said she felt like a fake person but is grateful for her new heart and for the ability to keep her alive during the waiting process Stabbed in Head and Survived Michael Hill now holds the Guinness World Book of Records title for Largest Object Removed From Human Skull but he probably wishes he never had to go that route Hill answered a friend s door in Jacksonville Florida and was stabbed in the head with a 20 cm 8 in survival knife on April 25 1998 Hill walked to another friend s house and they took him to Shands jacksonville Trauma Center Four hours after he arrived the knife was removed While he survived the wound caused permanent damage to his memory and paralyzed his left hand Man Cut in Half Survives and Now Walks Peng Shulin s body was cut in half by a lorry in 1995 Although it was a miracle that he survived he was chained to a bed for years as he developed skills to build up his arm muscles Recently doctors at the China Rehabilitation Research Centre in Beijing learned about Peng s plight and devised a way for him to walk on his own again The device is an egg like casing with two bionic legs attached Girl Survives Removal of Two Legs Two Arms Lakshmi Tatma was born attached to a headless identical twin sister a rare case that left Lakshmi unable to crawl or walk But she had one complete body with a near perfect set of organs so Dr Sharan Patil led a surgery team into one of the most complicated surgeries ever conducted to remove two year old Lakshmi s extra limbs and organs The surgery was successful which allows Lakshmi now to live a normal and hopefully long life Leaky Brain Fixed with Glue Ella Grace Honeyman was born with Vein of Galen malformation which causes tiny holes in brain blood vessels The seventeen month old girl was given just weeks to live when her parents hired a team of pioneering U S surgeons Those surgeons fired organic glue into the artery holes to plug them While the doctors saved her life the operations may be ongoing in a process to fix any new leaks This disease affects about 250 people in the world A Tooth for an Eye Martin Jones lose his left eye and was blinded in the right eye when a tub of molten aluminum exploded in his face twelve years ago Then he allowed surgeon Christopher Lui and his team to pull a canine from his mouth attach a tiny optical lens to that tooth and then implant the tooth into his eye socket The process took about four months but Martin can see again through that one eye And he seems to relish the shock that his eye gives to onlookers it s a bit spooky but serviceable Man Awakens After 20 Year Sleep In 1983 Terry Wallis suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident Twenty years later he emerged from what doctors call a minimally conscious state which is somewhere between being awake and being in a vegetative state Doctors now believe that Terry s brain built new pathways during those two decades that allowed him to become fully conscious and began to talk However he lost the ability to store new memories and he maintains physical disabilities from the original accident Electrodes Stimulate Dead Brain A patient was unable to communicate swallow or make coordinated physical movements for almost six years after he was seriously assaulted now can speak eat and laugh Doctors implanted electrodes into that man s brain using a stimulation technique already used on patients with Parkinson s disease A patient who receives this type of treatment and if it is appropriate to the case may receive immediate results Cured by a Spider Bite David Blancarte almost was killed in a motorcycle accident about two decades ago he survived but has been confined to a wheelchair Then he was bitten by a Brown Recluse spider a bite that sent him to a hospital for eight months But during that time he began to feel his legs and within five days David was walking again He may need to learn how to run however as he was arrested earlier this year for an outstanding warrant stemming from a domestic abuse case Did you enjoy this article "",""url"":""onlinebsn org
